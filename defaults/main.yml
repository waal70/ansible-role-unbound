# If you wish unbound randomizes outgoing IPv6 addresses from a netblock,
# set the host variable 'ipv6_netblock' with a netblock ("aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::/64")
# Do not forget to subsequently add a route in your router using this netblock
# If you do not have this host variable, the outgoing interface defaults to the
# device's configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
